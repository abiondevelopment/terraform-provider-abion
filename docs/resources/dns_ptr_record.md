## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name to create records for. For example `@`, `www`, `ftp`, `www.east`. The `@` character represents the root of the zone.
- `records` (Attributes List) The list of PTR records. Records are sorted to avoid constant changing plans (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--records))
- `zone` (String) The zone the record belongs to.

<a id="nestedatt--records"></a>
### Nested Schema for `records`

Required:

- `ptr` (String) The canonical name this record will point to.

Optional:

- `comments` (String) Comments for the record.
- `ttl` (Number) Time-to-live (TTL) for the record, in seconds.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# DNS PTR records can be imported by specifying the string identifier. The import ID should be in the format: "zone/name". The `@` character represents the root of the zone, E.g., "example.com/@"
terraform import abion_dns_ptr_record.example "example.com/www"
```
