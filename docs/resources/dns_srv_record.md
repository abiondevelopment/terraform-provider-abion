# abion_dns_srv_record (Resource)

Use this resource to create, update and delete DNS SRV records of a zone.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    abion = {
      source = "abion/abion"
    }
  }
}

provider "abion" {
  apikey = "<api key>"
}

resource "abion_dns_srv_record" "example" {
  zone = "example.com"
  name = "www"
  records = [
    {
      target   = "server1.example.com."
      port     = "443"
      priority = "1"
      weight   = "100"
    },
    {
      target   = "server2.example.com."
      port     = "443"
      priority = "100"
      weight   = "10"
      comments = "test comment"
    },
    {
      target   = "server3.example.com."
      port     = "443"
      priority = "100"
      weight   = "30"
      ttl      = "300"
    },
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name to create records for. For example `@`, `www`, `ftp`, `www.east`. The `@` character represents the root of the zone.
- `records` (Attributes List) The list of SRV records. Records are sorted to avoid constant changing plans (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--records))
- `zone` (String) The zone the record belongs to.

<a id="nestedatt--records"></a>
### Nested Schema for `records`

Required:

- `port` (Number) The TCP or UDP port on which the service is running.
- `priority` (Number) The priority specifying the priority of the target host. Lower values indicate higher priority.
- `target` (String) The hostname of the machine providing the service.
- `weight` (Number) A relative weight for records with the same priority. Higher weights are more preferred.

Optional:

- `comments` (String) Comments for the record.
- `ttl` (Number) Time-to-live (TTL) for the record, in seconds.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# DNS SRV records can be imported by specifying the string identifier. The import ID should be in the format: "zone/name". The `@` character represents the root of the zone, E.g., "example.com/@"
terraform import abion_dns_srv_record.example "example.com/www"
```
