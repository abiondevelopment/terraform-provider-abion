## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name to fetch records for. For example `@`, `www`, `ftp`, `www.east`. The `@` character represents the root of the zone.
- `zone` (String) The zone the record belongs to.

### Read-Only

- `records` (Attributes List) The list of SRV records. Records are sorted to avoid constant changing plans (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--records))

### Nested Schema for `records`

Required:

- `port` (Number) The TCP or UDP port on which the service is running.
- `priority` (Number) The priority specifying the priority of the target host. Lower values indicate higher priority.
- `target` (String) The hostname of the machine providing the service.
- `weight` (Number) A relative weight for records with the same priority. Higher weights are more preferred.

Optional:

- `comments` (String) Comments for the record.
- `ttl` (Number) Time-to-live (TTL) for the record, in seconds.
